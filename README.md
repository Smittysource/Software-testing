By rigorously testing the code that I create, I can help to ensure that the software is fully functional and secure. Though it is impossible to prove that a larger piece of software is completely error free, testing allows a chance to check that it is not completely error prone or nonfunctional.

It is important to check with the client to ensure that all of their requirements are well defined before beginning development on a system. It is impossible to build a good piece of software without knowing what it is supposed to do. After getting well defined user requirements, it is important to develop the software to meet those requirements and then check the the developed code to ensure that it performs as expected.

Rushing into developing the application will not result in a successful project. Designing and planning are critical steps to creating a successful application.
